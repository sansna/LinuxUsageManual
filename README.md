Linux Usage Manual
==

Actually this repo is created because linux has so many
different systems, and their usages and common commands
differ so much that I thought, I shall forget some of
the useful commands I used in the past.. I must then put
my learning fruits in this repo.. for a quick ref.

I have been using quite a few systems, but only OSes
which I consider are really in great need of taking 
notes are shared in this repo.

Also, these manuals are created and synthesized based on
web-info, in my appetite, may not fit your style. But
any way, if you are interested, tell me your thoughts.
Maybe they can be some help to new-comers.

Thanks for your time.
